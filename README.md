## purpose of this repository

These are the first lessons I learned through my coding journey. 

These basic rules are for anyone who is new to coding. And I encourage others to include their first repository or website, even if it was way too long ago or it is outdated. The history of our journey's should be valuable, especially when there is always room for growth.

An insight of that growth is always valuable.

Coding is like math, to me. It requires a lot of practice and dedication. Coding is also about how everything you do matters; missing a lowercase, an uppercase, or even a semicolon can mess up and bug up your creations.

### My history

At first, I started making formulas with Microsoft Excel. I could make nested "if" functions very easily and my formulas would go through 5-7 lines and sometimes I did so much that I couldn't follow my own formula. However, I always knew what the goal was. And most the times, in my past jobs, these formulas worked and my employers considered me an expert with Excel, even if I had not been familiar with other coding languages or using Macros.

Overall, my journey has taught me to be resilient and be patient when trying to figure out what the problems are. Coding is a specialty that, most of the times, can not be solved by AI. Overall, it encompasses a lot of figuring out how to debug through being attentive to detail, or reading the documentation from the resources on the internet.

Pro Tip: Always make sure to do research, especially when there is much to learn.

My History
I began by creating formulas in Microsoft Excel. I could easily make nested "if" functions, and my formulas often extended through 5-7 lines. Although I sometimes struggled to keep track of my own formulas, I always understood the goal. In my past jobs, these formulas often worked, and my employers considered me an expert with Excel, even though I was not familiar with other coding languages or using Macros.

Overall, my journey has taught me to be resilient and patient when solving problems. Coding often cannot be solved by AI alone. It involves figuring out how to debug by being attentive to detail or reading documentation from online resources.

Pro Tip: Always ensure to do research, especially when there is much to learn.
