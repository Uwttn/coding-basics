# coding-basics
Purpose of This Repository
These lessons mark the beginning of my coding journey.

These basic principles are for anyone new to coding. I encourage others to include their first repository or website, regardless of how long ago it was or if it is outdated. The history of our journeys is valuable, especially when there is always room for growth.

An insight into that growth is always valuable.

Coding is like math to me; it requires a lot of practice and dedication. Coding is also about attention to detail; missing a lowercase, an uppercase, or even a semicolon can create bugs in your creations.

# My History
I began by creating formulas in Microsoft Excel. I could easily make nested "if" functions, and my formulas often extended through 5-7 lines. Although I sometimes struggled to keep track of my own formulas, I always understood the goal. In my past jobs, these formulas often worked, and my employers considered me an expert with Excel, even though I was not familiar with other coding languages or using Macros.

Overall, my journey has taught me to be resilient and patient when solving problems. Coding often cannot be solved by AI alone. It involves figuring out how to debug by being attentive to detail or reading documentation from online resources.

Pro Tip: Always ensure to do research, especially when there is much to learn.
